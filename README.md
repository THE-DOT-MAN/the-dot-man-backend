## Deploying to Render

Follow these steps to deploy your backend to Render and get it live:

### Step 1: Create a Render Account
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (or sign in if you already have one)
3. You can sign up with GitHub for easier integration

### Step 2: Create a New Web Service
1. From your Render dashboard, click **"New +"** button
2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
4. Find and select the `the-dot-man-backend` repository
5. Click **"Connect"**

### Step 3: Configure Your Web Service

Render will auto-detect that this is a Node.js app. Configure the following settings:

- **Name**: `the-dot-man-backend` (or any name you prefer)
- **Region**: Choose the region closest to you or your users
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Root Directory**: Leave blank (or `.` if needed)
- **Environment**: `Node`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Plan**: Select **"Free"** (perfect for testing and development)

### Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)

You can set environment variables if needed:
- Click **"Advanced"** to expand options
- Add environment variables if you need any (none required for basic setup)
- The `PORT` environment variable is automatically set by Render

### Step 5: Deploy!

1. Click **"Create Web Service"**
2. Render will start building and deploying your app
3. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
4. You'll see the build logs in real-time

### Step 6: Get Your Live URL

Once deployment is complete:
1. Your app will be available at: `https://the-dot-man-backend.onrender.com` (or your custom name)
2. Test your endpoints:
   - Root: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/`
   - Inbox: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/inbox`
   - Health: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health`

### Important Notes for Render

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Free tier apps spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity**. The first request after inactivity may take 30-60 seconds to respond.
- ‚úÖ Render automatically runs `npm install` and `npm start`
- ‚úÖ Your app will auto-deploy when you push changes to the `main` branch
- ‚úÖ HTTPS is provided automatically
- ‚úÖ Environment variables can be updated in the Render dashboard without redeploying

### Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in the Render dashboard
2. Ensure `package.json` is in the root directory
3. Verify that the start script is correctly defined
4. Make sure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`

## Testing Your Deployed API

Once deployed, test your API with curl:

```bash
# Test root endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/

# Test inbox endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/inbox

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health
```

Or visit the URLs directly in your browser!
